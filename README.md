# Time Series

This is my repository working with time series data. I will focus on visualizations and forecasting methods, start off with simple moving averages, drif and other methods to forecast.

I have implemented a 50/200 day moving average function that works very well. I did use sendtex finance guide since I rememberd he used the rolling function. Here is an example picture
